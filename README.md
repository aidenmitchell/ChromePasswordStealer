# ChromePasswordStealer

A simple script that outputs all passwords in Google Chrome to a text file on the desktop. 

Uses [ChromePass](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chromepass.html) to output passwords.

The script is designed to remain undetected by Windows Defender on Windows 10, by excluding all .exe files from detection before running, because under normal circumstances ChromePass is detected as a hacktool.

This is for research purposes only, please do not use this to steal passwords.
